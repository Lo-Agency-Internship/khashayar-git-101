| Word      | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Branch |A parallel copy of our main project that can be modified to fix a bug or add a feature without damaging the main one. |
| Checkout |A git command that switchs between files, branches or commits. |
| Commit |A git command that saves the latest changes of our files(snapshot) after adding them to the staging area to the commit history of the repository. |
| Fast-forward |A special kind of merging that occurs when there is a direct linear path from the source to the target branch(if there is not a divergent route between the two branches). |
| Fetch |A git command that downloads the files,commits and refs from the remote repo to the local repo but does not merge the downloaded files. Instead it allows the user to check the updates and review them before taking any action in merging. |
| Head |It is a pointer that points to the current branch that user is working on. |
| Merge |A git command that integrates the multiple lines of works(branches) to a single branch. |
| Remote |The main repo which all the developers work on it and commit their work on it. |
| Origin |The shorthand name of the repository that the project was cloned from. Its usage is to make referencing easier. |
|  Up-stream |The location where all the works are uploaded(the original repo).|
|  Down-stream |The process of integrating the work with others. |
| Pull |A git command included by Fetch and Merge commands. This action downloads and apply the new changes on the local repository and updates the files to the new commits created by other users in the remote repository. |
| Push |A git command that sends and uploads the commits and latest changes to the remote repository. |
| Repository |A database that records all the changes occured on the files of a project in Git.|
| Stash |A git command that saves the uncommited changes into a stack for a later use and discards them by making a clean working place by matching the HEAD commit. |
|clone|an action of copying an remote repository from git account to local directory. |
|rebase|similar to merging for branches, but it will renew the node base in a way that will make it the same in the project line, in other words base will be changed to new state|
|cherrypick|applying an specific commit from a specific branch to local repository|
